### Description

The Markdown parser converts footnotes into hyperlinks, where the link target 
is the note text at the bottom of the document.

While this behavior is adequate for printed books, ebooks are a different 
mattter. The "footnotes at the end of the chapter" approach does not work
well for electronic reading devices or applications because the notes stand 
in the way of the normal reading flow.

This plugin collects all footnotes markup generated by the Markdown parser
(at the end of each book element) and then generates a consolidated
footnotes list element with all the book's footnotes.

with a summary of terms processed and problems found.
