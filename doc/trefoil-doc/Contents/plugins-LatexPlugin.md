## LatexPlugin

This add-in provides limited support for **LaTeX**, allowing formulas to be embedded into workbooks.

It makes use of the `Gladtex` utility: <https://humenda.github.io/GladTeX/>

### Availability

This plugin is available for all editions.

### Usage

~~~.yaml
# <book-dir>/config.yml 

easybook:
  parameters:
    gladtex:
      path: /usr/bin/gladtex

book:
    editions:
        <edition-name>
            plugins:
                enabled: [ Latex ]
                options:
                    Latex:
                        font_size: 12                        
~~~

### Description

**LaTeX** formulas can be seamlessly include into books using special delimiters:

- This is an inline formula &#92;( u = \pi\cdot d &#92;) that is rendered in the same line.

- This is a displayed formula:  
&#92;[  
A = 4 * \sqrt{x^2+1}  
&#92;]


The previous examples will render as:

- This is an inline formula \( u = \pi\cdot d \) that is rendered in the same line.

- This is a displayed formula that will render on a separate line:  
\[ 
A = 4 * \sqrt{x^2+1}
\]
