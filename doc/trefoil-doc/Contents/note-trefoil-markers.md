N> ##### What are Trefoil markers?
N> Trefoil markers are a kind of function call wich produces HTML code to be
N> processed later. They are similar to `Twig` function calls but are enclosed
N> between `{@ ... @}` delimiters.
N> The "======" series between the opening `{@` and the function name is an optional
N> delimiter to help visually identifiying the block in the text.
