# LatexPlugin test 2

## Same as test 1

This has the same content as test 1 but in different order, to test the correct
generation of latex formula files without name collisions.

### Displayed (centered) formulas

Centered formula with `\[.. \]` delimiters inline (`\sqrt{x^2+1}`): \\[ \sqrt{x^2+1} \\]

Centered formula with `\[.. \]` delimiters multiline (`A = 4 * \sqrt{x^2+1}`):
\\[
A = 4 * \sqrt{x^2+1}
\\]

### Inline formulas

Inline formula with `\( ... \)` delimiters (`u = \pi\cdot d`): \\( u = \pi\cdot d \\) consectetur adipisici elit.


## Additional to test 1

And this is an additional formula not found in test 1.
\\[
\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a + b} = a - b
\\]
